# Gig Jobs App - V0.1 Features

## Overview
A voice-first web application for connecting service providers with people who need help with spare-time gigs.

## Key Features

### 1. Voice-First Interface
- Uses Web Speech API for voice recognition
- Works best in Chrome/Edge browsers
- Real-time transcription of voice input
- Visual feedback with animated microphone button

### 2. Service Provider Flow
- **Step 1**: Voice input for name
- **Step 2**: Voice input for skills (e.g., "I can do dog walking, babysitting, and tutoring")
- **Step 3**: App suggests similar skills based on what user mentioned
- Skills are stored in localStorage
- Automatic location detection via Geolocation API

### 3. Service Requester Flow
- **Step 1**: Voice input for requester name
- **Step 2**: Voice input for job description (e.g., "I need someone to walk my dog")
- App automatically:
  - Determines hourly rate based on job type
  - Finds nearby providers with matching skills
  - Creates job request and notifies providers
  - Shows first provider who accepts

### 4. Job Matching System
- **Location-based**: Matches providers within same city or 10km radius
- **Skill-based**: Uses keyword matching to find relevant providers
- **Rate calculation**: Automatically suggests rates based on job type:
  - Tutoring: $20-40/hour (suggested: $30)
  - Babysitting: $15-25/hour (suggested: $20)
  - Pet care: $12-20/hour (suggested: $15)
  - Companionship: $10-18/hour (suggested: $14)
  - Shopping/Errands: $10-15/hour (suggested: $12)
  - Cleaning: $15-25/hour (suggested: $20)
  - Default: $10-20/hour (suggested: $15)

### 5. Job Notifications
- Providers see available jobs matching their skills
- Real-time updates (checks every 3 seconds)
- Accept/Decline functionality
- Shows job details, rate, and requester info

### 6. Data Storage (V0.1)
- Uses browser localStorage (no backend required)
- Stores:
  - Provider profiles (name, skills, location)
  - Job requests
  - Job matches
- Data persists across sessions

## Design Theme
- **Primary Colors**: White background with Clay Pink (#D4A5A5) accents
- **UI Elements**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, smooth animations
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Stack
- React 18.2
- Web Speech API (browser-native)
- Geolocation API
- localStorage for data persistence

## Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome, Edge (full Web Speech API support)
- **Limited**: Firefox, Safari (may have limited voice recognition)

## Known Limitations (V0.1)
1. No real-time notifications (uses polling)
2. No user authentication (uses localStorage IDs)
3. Location matching is simplified (city-based or 10km radius)
4. No payment integration

6. Simulated provider acceptance (auto-accepts after 3 seconds)

## Next Steps for V0.2
- Backend API integration
- Real-time notifications (WebSockets)
