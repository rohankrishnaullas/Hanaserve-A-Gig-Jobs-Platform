## 🎬 ALTERNATIVE SCRIPTS

### Version B: More Personal (Face-to-Camera Start)

**[0:00 - 0:08] INTRO**
> "Hi, I'm Rohan, and I've spent hours trying to find specific help - a cook for 3 days, someone to wait in line at the RTO. There had to be a better way."

### Version C: Problem-Heavy (For Impact-Focused Incubators)

**[0:00 - 0:12] PROBLEM**
> "300 million informal workers in India have diverse skills but platforms pigeonhole them. A student who can tutor, code, AND pet-sit gets listed as just one thing. And millions who don't speak English can't even onboard."

**[0:12 - 0:20] SOLUTION**
> "Hanaserve changes this. Voice-first onboarding in any language. Multi-skill identity. AI that matches, not restricts."

**[0:20 - 0:50]** *[Demo flow]*

**[0:50 - 0:60] IMPACT**
> "We're democratizing gig work - making it accessible to everyone, regardless of language or skills. Try our live demo today."
