## The Problem

India's local services market is fundamentally broken—on both sides.

### For Requesters: Fragmentation and Rigid Categories

Life doesn't fit into app categories. When you need someone to pick up your bike, take it 15km to a service center, wait while it's repaired, and bring it back—no app handles that. You're stuck juggling Dunzo, Urban Company, Porter, making endless calls, comparing prices, reading reviews, and often just giving up in frustration. Real needs are specific, multi-step, and deeply personal. Existing platforms force you into rigid boxes that simply don't match how real life actually works.

### For Providers: Onboarding Barriers Lock Out Millions

Traditional gig platforms demand extensive documentation, background verification processes, full-time commitment, and narrow skill categorization. This locks out millions of capable people: the college student free on weekends, the retired uncle who's great at fixing things, the neighbor who could cook for your party, the homemaker with spare afternoon hours. These "occasional providers" have valuable skills and genuine willingness to help—but can't navigate, or simply don't want to deal with, the complexity of formal gig platforms.

### The Result: A Massive Market Mismatch

Requesters with unmet needs they've stopped trying to fulfill. Providers with untapped capacity sitting idle in every neighborhood. And no platform that speaks their language—literally.

There's no interface where you can simply describe what you need in natural conversation and find someone nearby who can help. No system that onboards providers through a quick chat instead of endless forms. No bridge between "I need help" and "I can help."

**This isn't just inconvenience—it's a market failure worth billions, waiting to be solved.**

## Our Solution

Hanaserve is a conversational service layer—accessible via chat or voice—that connects users with local service providers through natural language. The platform solves both sides of the market problem:

### For Service Providers: Frictionless Onboarding

Seamless onboarding for anyone offering one-time or occasional services. No complex registration forms—just have a conversation with our AI assistant "Hana," describe your skills, availability, and service area, and you're listed. This unlocks the massive untapped supply of people willing to help occasionally but deterred by traditional gig platform friction.

### For Requesters: Concierge-Style Experience

A concierge-like experience where you simply describe what you need—"I need someone to take my bike 15km for servicing and bring it back"—and our intelligent matching algorithm finds providers who can fulfill even hyper-specific, multi-step requests that don't fit into predefined app categories.

### User Control: Your Choice of Autonomy

Hanaserve offers flexibility—let Hana operate with full autonomy to find, match, and coordinate with the best provider automatically, or take control and manually select from matched providers if you prefer a hands-on approach.

## How It Works

### Provider Flow
1. Start a conversation with Hana (chat or voice)
2. Describe your skills, availability, and service area naturally
3. Hana creates your flexible provider profile automatically
4. Receive matched service requests when requesters need your skills

### Requester Flow
1. Describe what you need to Hana in natural language
2. Hana understands your request, including implicit requirements
3. Get matched with capable local providers
4. Choose to let Hana handle coordination or select providers yourself
